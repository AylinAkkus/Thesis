\begin{abstract}
We present Gelato-30B-A3B, a state-of-the-art grounding model for GUI computer-use tasks. Gelato is trained on our open-sourced Click-100k dataset and achieves 63.88\% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 69.15\% / 74.65\% on OS-World-G / OS-World-G (Refined), surpassing prior specialized computer grounding models like GTA1-32B and much larger vision-language models including Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct. When combined with GPT-5, Gelato enables strong agentic performance at 58.71\% automated success rate (61.85\% with human evaluation) versus 56.97\% (59.47\% with human evaluation) for GTA1-32B on OS-World. This thesis describes the complete pipeline from data curation and filtering to reinforcement learning training that enables these results.
