\subsection{GUI Grounding Datasets}

Our training data comprises multiple open-source GUI grounding datasets, from which we extract desktop samples and pointwise click actions. When datasets provide full computer-use trajectories rather than individual grounding annotations, we extract click actions and generate corresponding instructions using large language models. A detailed overview of all data sources and sample counts is provided in Section~\ref{sec:data_curation}.

\paragraph{General-Purpose Training Data}
Our primary data pool (Table~\ref{tab:dataset_statistics} in Section~\ref{sec:data_curation}) combines eight complementary sources. UGround \cite{gou2024uground} provides web-based samples synthesized from HTML structures and paired with natural language referring expressions. AutoGUI \cite{li2025autogui} contributes functionality-focused annotations generated by analyzing state changes before and after interactions. ShowUI \cite{lin2024showui} spans web, mobile, and desktop environments emphasizing cross-device generalization. OS-Atlas \cite{wu2024osatlas} covers multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android) synthesized using cross-platform tooling.

Additional sources include WaveUI \cite{agentsea2024waveui} for diverse desktop interfaces, PC-Agent-E \cite{he2025pcagente} providing trajectory-based Windows data, PixMo Points \cite{deitke2024molmo} offering high-quality visual grounding annotations, and SeeClick \cite{cheng2024seeclick} contributing web and mobile UI samples. Together, these datasets provide broad coverage of standard consumer interfaces and common web interactions.

\paragraph{Professional Application Data}
To address underrepresentation of professional desktop software, we incorporate two specialized datasets. UI-Vision \cite{nayak2025uivision} provides densely annotated samples from real-world productivity applications, including professional tools typically inaccessible to automated collection methods. JEDI \cite{xie2025jedi} contributes samples emphasizing complex desktop environments, office software, and system applications. These datasets specifically target high-resolution, functionally rich interfaces characteristic of professional workflows that dominate challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-Pro.
