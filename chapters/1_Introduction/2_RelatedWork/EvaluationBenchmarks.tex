\subsection{Evaluation Benchmarks}

\textbf{ScreenSpot-Pro}~\cite{screenspot} offers GUI grounding evaluation for professional high-resolution computer use, providing a challenging benchmark for measuring grounding accuracy.

\textbf{OS-World-G}~\cite{osworld} scale computer-use grounding via user interface decomposition and synthesis, introducing both isolated grounding benchmarks and end-to-end agent evaluation tasks.
