\subsection{Grounding Models and Computer-use Agents}

\textbf{GTA1}~\cite{yang2025gta1} introduces GUI test-time scaling agents and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for grounding tasks. GTA1 establishes strong baselines that our work builds upon and compares against.

\textbf{UI-TARS 1.5}~\cite{qin2025uitars} pioneers automated GUI interaction with native agents, providing base models suitable for further fine-tuning on grounding tasks.

\textbf{UI-Venus}~\cite{gu2025uivenus} builds high-performance UI agents with rejected sampling fine-tuning (RFT), demonstrating alternative training approaches for grounding models.

\textbf{SE-GUI}~\cite{yuan2025segui} enhances visual grounding for GUI agents via self-evolutionary reinforcement learning, introducing data quality filtering methods that inform our approach.

\textbf{OmniParser}~\cite{lu2024omniparser} provides pure vision-based GUI agent capabilities and UI element detection, which we leverage in our filtering pipeline.
