\section{Reinforcement Learning Methods}

\textbf{GRPO}~\cite{grpo} (Group Relative Policy Optimization), introduced in the DeepSeekMath work, provides an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that we adapt for grounding model training.

\textbf{DAPO}~\cite{dapo} presents an open-source LLM reinforcement learning system at scale, demonstrating simplified RL objectives by removing KL-divergence terms, which we incorporate into our training approach.
